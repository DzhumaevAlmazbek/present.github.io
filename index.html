						<h3>Meeting in the sky</h3>
						<br />
						<p>
						When I was in the darkness <br />
						Not knowing what to do, <br />
						I met you in the sky <br />
						Surrounded by clouds, <br />
						As white as the candle <br />
						You gave me that time. <br />
						<br />
						You introduced me to your friends, <br />
						Who became my friends as well. <br />
						Endy, Dara, you and me, <br />
						We were getting closer day by day, <br />
						Spending time, collecting lights, <br />
						We did it all together. <br />
						<br />
						It's already three months left <br />
						Since we met each other. <br />
						And I was happy all this time <br />
						Because you, baby, <br />
						Became my light, the light <br />
						That makes me feel alright.

						<h3>Paths</h3>
						<br />
						I choose a path for me. <br />
						The path that goes to you. <br />
						It's full of pits and obstacles, <br />
						But I'm gonna break through. <br />
						<br />
						If we meet one day, <br />
						I won't let you go. <br />
						Cause our paths will <br />
						Merge into one. <br />
						<br />
						It may last long, <br />
						It may be short. <br />
						But in the end <br />
						We just need to be strong. <br />
						<br />
						I wish you live happily <br />
						And smile as always. <br />
						This beautiful smile, <br />
						This beautiful and gorgeous.

						Everything what we have, <br />
						Everything what we feel, <br />

						My feelings and your feelings, <br />
						My warmth and your warmth, <br />
						Let them fill the space in our hearts, <br />
						Let them exist between us.

						I have to find the cunning thief, <br />
						Who stole the heart of mine. <br />
						One day we have to face each other, <br />
						I hope until this she'll be fine. <br />
						<br />
						She filled the space in my heart <br />
						And made me feel alive. <br />
						Sometimes I don't know what to say, <br />
						When she's about to cry. <br />
						<br />
						She's feeling not that good these days, <br />
						So I wanna make her shine. <br />
						Shine as the eyes of the beautiful thief, <br />
						Who stole the heart of mine.</div>

						<h3>Let me know</h3>

							I don't know what you feel, <br />
							When you're quiet and peaceful, <br />
							Keeping everything inside, <br />
							Feeling sad about it. <br />
							<br />
							I want to know why you're upset, <br />
							Cause I know how it feels <br />
							When you have many things in your mind, <br />
							But have no one to reveal. <br />
							<br />
							When you think that you're alone, <br />
							When you need someone to come, <br />
							When the sadness is being born, <br />
							Remember about everything you have. <br />
							<br />
							About your family and relatives, <br />
							About your friends and collectives, <br />
							About your hometown and house, <br />
							About your baby who loves.

						<h3>My Light</h3>

						Every word you said to me, <br />
						Every moment we spent together. <br />
						It makes me think about you. <br />
						I think whole day about you. <br />
						<br />
						And when you say that you're okay, <br />
						You don't act like usually. <br />
						And I can't fully trust you, <br />
						Cause I'm worrying about you. <br />
						<br />
						I hate the fact that I can't help you, <br />
						And I blame myself for doing nothing. <br />
						But I want to find solution <br />
						To make you feel much better. <br />
						<br />
						What I write belongs to you, <br />
						And my heart belongs to you. <br />
						Will you give me yours too? <br />
						Will you love me as I love you?

			  <span>Dear Ruby Ann Napoles Ysidoro,</span> I want to tell you something. 
			  <br /> 
			  <br /> 
			  For a long time I was doubting myself and not knowing what to do, but at
			  this day 3 months ago something life-changing happened. And it was
			  your appearance in my life. You become the light that illuminated it.
			  You are the reason why I started to work harder, you are the one who
			  helped me get rid of endless anxiety and become more confident. You
			  caught my attention at first day we met. And slowly I had feelings
			  for you. And day by day they grew stronger. Every single moment,
			  when we were together, made and still making me happier. I hope you
			  feel the same way. And every day I give thanks and pray to God that
			  one day we'll become the good loving <span>family. </span> I want to do everything
			  I can, so it'll come true. <br /> I made this project in case
			  to make you feel better, because you're busy <br /> and stressed these
			  days. <br /> <br /> Thank you for everything you gave me, my baby. <br />  <br /> And yes, I'm
			  not good at writing beautiful words, <br /> but I want you to know one
			  thing: <span>I LOVE YOU.</span>
